# 5 Use Cases for Graph Technology

## When your data is complex, the solution is in the graph

Most companies have a data problem. The more complicated the problem, the more likely a graph data platform can solve it. Neo4j helps the world make sense of data by identifying connections and plotting relationships otherwise unseen amidst never-ending streams of data. 

## Here are five of the top use cases for graph technology.

### Fraud Detection
Banks and insurance companies lose billions every year to fraud.

Fintech firm TODO1 uses Neo4j to power a proprietary fraud detection application capable of sustaining hundreds of transactions a second, spending merely tens of milliseconds on a single query, thanks to the streamlined logic behind the Cypher query language.

### Real-Time Recommendations

To be relevant and prevent a potential customer from clicking to a competitor, recommendations must be contextual and instantaneous.

Running in Neo4j, Bechtle’s recommendation system generates a detailed model of all the actions customers take on the website. “We see which products end up in the shopping cart after which search terms,” said Kovacs. “This helps us to continuously optimize the system and improve navigation for visitors and customers alike.”

### Bill of Materials

For vehicles, durable goods, and more, tracking every component and its cost, what equipment the components relate to, and the expected product lifespan/average time to failure into a mass bill of materials (BoM) is a behemoth operation for an organization like the United States Army, which deploys a staggering amount of equipment.

The Army uses Neo4j to rapidly collect and combine this massive BoM information
and save analysts huge amounts of time. Answers are immediate. Using Neo4j, the Army can now forecast the need for replacement parts, accurately calculate mean time to failure, and answer vital “what-if” questions about the cost of deploying forces.

### Track & Trace

Graph data models enable traceability for a variety of industries and use cases, including routing, logistics, supply chain management, and compliance. Track and trace enables us to find out the status of a product (batch, mail/ parcel, train, ship, container, etc.) wherever it is in the supply chain and to identify and verify its path.

Think about a pharmaceutical company using track and trace to improve recall management. Batches can be recalled for many different reasons, but the most common is the detection of faulty ingredients within a given batch. With
data from systems of record coalesced in a knowledge graph, the whereabouts of the affected batch across storage locations, wholesalers, and retailer stocks can be determined so that remedial action can be taken quickly, improving patient safety and reducing the costs associated with the recall.

### Network & IT Ops

Graph databases are a natural fit for network and IT ops; after
all, a network is a graph. The graph’s connected structure enables network managers to conduct sophisticated impact analyses

Digital transformation requires modernizing the IT landscape and demands crystal clear visibility into current systems. Commonwealth Bank uses Neo4j to easily map out its business applications and see relationships in a highly visual and intuitive way using graphs.

# The Return on Connected Data

## Connections Unlock the Value of Data

The value of data comes from an organization’s ability to understand it in relation to other data. By itself, data offers finite value. When connected, data’s value is infinite. 

Increasing data’s connectedness further increases its value through additional context. 

Because relational databases don’t persist relationship information in storage or any other stage of their analytic exercises, finding connections requires an enormous amount of extra processing. And persisting these connections over their lifetime is next to impossible.

## Data, Data Everywhere, Nor any Drop to Drink

Like the ancient mariner at sea, organizations are surrounded by data but they’re limited in their ability to do anything with it. 

Despite having plenty of data, and data integration tools, organizations are failing to realize big data’s value. That’s because the value isn’t in disparate data but in the relationships, or connections, between the data — and this information is not easily available. 

Data becomes connected when you treat relationship information as a first-class entity — persisting it, assigning properties to it, and using it as a means to develop context for applications. Thus, it’s best to think of big data needing to be connected, not merely contained.

## The Power of Connected Data

The biggest benefit of connected data is the ability to provide a connected view of the data to your analytic and operational applications, thereby gaining and growing intelligence downstream. 

You also obtain context that allows you to more deeply or better refine the pieces of information you’re collecting or the recommendations you’re producing. Marketing may determine the best time to send an email to customers who previously purchased winter coats and dynamically display photos in their preferred colors. The more understanding you have of the connectedness or of the relationships between data, the better and more refined your system is downstream. 

Connected data is most powerful when it provides operational, real-time insights and not just after-the-fact analytics. Real-time insights allow business users and applications to make business decisions and act in real-time. 

## Quench Your Thirst for Insights with Connected Data

Think of a graph data model as a mind map composed of two elements: A node and a relationship. Each node represents an entity, and each relationship represents how two nodes are associated. By assembling the simple abstractions of nodes and relationships into connected structures (imagine connecting two circles with an arrow or line), a graph database enables you to build sophisticated models that map closely to a problem domain.

Identifying connections in your data is only helpful if you know what to do with them. Graphs can help you with that, too. Today’s applications, whether they be recommendation engines or anti-money laundering systems, are powered by graphs. The graph database operationalizes the data by making it possible for the app to traverse the data. Once you have this ability, the data becomes actionable.

## Neo4j: Your Path to Connected Data

Neo4j offers an innovative, reliable native graph platform that reveals and maintains the integrity of connected data from the moment it’s conceived through each stage of design, development, analysis, implementation, and operation. Neo4j offers this connections-first approach as a new paradigm to reveal and utilize relationships among data in order to help organizations along their path to new generations of applications and analytic advancements. 

Not only does Neo4j make connected data possible; it makes connected data easy. As graphs are built out of your data, Neo4j automatically creates connections as they exist and reveals connections that you may have never considered.

## Conclusion

The difference in value is like moving from two dimensions into five, or from black and white to 3D technicolor. With Neo4j, enabling connected data is easy. Organizations can use all their data more effectively, improving data quality, driving revenue through real-time
recommendations, preventing fraud, and running their operations smoothly and securely.

## What Are Graph Databases Good for?

Graph data stores are intuitive because they mirror the way the human brain thinks and maps associations via neurons (nodes) and synapses (relationships). A graph database efficiently stores and queries connected data in a node-and-relationships format

- Fraud Detection & Analytics
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Real-Time Recommendation Engines
- Knowledge Graphs
- Network & Database Infrastructure Monitoring
- Master Data Management (MDM)

Viewed through a technological lens, graph databases tackle the most harrowing of data problems – ones that often linger at the root of project failures and delays. These include:

- Vastly different views of the data model between business and technology teams, which result in misunderstanding and miscommunication.
- Lack of schema flexibility and adaptability, making it hard to respond to changing business requirements both during a project and after a system has gone live.
- The “JOIN problem” which occurs when queries become so tangled that even powerful databases with massive amounts of hardware resources grind to a halt in their attempts to bring the resulting data together.


## Traditional Technology Choices Do Not Consider How Data Is Interrelated

Today’s data and applications require elasticity, agility, speed and interconnectivity. Despite the name, relational databases are not well-suited for modeling and storing today’s highly connected and agile datasets. RDBMS demand slow and expensive schema redesigns that hurt agile software development processes and hinder your ability to scale and innovate
quickly.

## Collections vs. Connections

### SQL & NoSQL Systems Focus on Data Aggregation & Collection

Collection-centric storage designs as implemented by SQL and Not only SQL (NoSQL) databases are designed to efficiently divide and store data.

In SQL’s case, the normalization of data into a tabular schema aims to minimize storage of duplicate data objects, types and values.

NoSQL systems like document, wide column and key-value data stores carry those concepts forward (and backward) by simplifying their models in exchange for higher levels of scale and simplicity.

### Graph Systems Focus on Data Connections 
By contrast, graph database technologies focus on how data elements are interrelated and contextualized as connected data. 

In the graph model, data relationships are persisted so they can be navigated or traversed along connected paths to gain context. Relationships are both typed and directional. 

## Property Graphs Are Intentionally Simple 

- You can draw property graphs on whiteboards and map that design directly into a graph database. 
- You can change or update a property graph easily, because its agile design eliminates most of the structural overhead of traditional database schemas.
- You can quickly program property graphs because their query language expresses and follows relationships.
- You can visualize and navigate property graphs efficiently by following the relationships on their paths to context.


## Benefits of Graph Databases
-  Simple and natural data modeling
-  Flexibility for evolving data structures
-  Simultaneous support for real-time updates and queries
-  Better, faster and more powerful querying and analytics
